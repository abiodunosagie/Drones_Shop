# Drone Shop Application

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Hi my name is Abiodun Osagie Olise, a one year flutter developer and i built this under a week as requested.
i didn't connect the database because, i don't know how to yet and still not too strong on the logic too.
Now i created an app per your request but not completely. So i installed a carousel package from 
pub.dev and created a continuous slider with it added images and also title and description. but i got lost
where i created a class and it's properties also created it's constructors too and made it required
i got lost in my own code on where to instantiate it. Also since i got the project, i have made 4 apps hahah
and deleted. Firstly i created one with a listview but had issues instantiating my properties too. This is
what i am abel to come up with, with the short time given. Also, fell on the error of not knowing how 
to put in a header above too.

Package used:
www.pub.dev
Package name: Carousel_slider
Added dependencies through the terminal: flutter pub add carousel_slider
